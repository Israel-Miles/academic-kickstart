I am a first year graduate student at Syracuse University working towards a PhD in computer science. My research interests include optimization, neural networks and stochastic methods, though I'm broadly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Outside of my education I am involved in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and play classical piano.
