title: "How I Went From Cleaning Carpets to Writing Code"
subtitle: "From riding in a van that caught fire four times, to a coding interview with nothing but a notebook and orange pen. This is how I got my first software engineering internship."
summary: "This article anecdotally describes how I obtained my first software engineering internship, with a few tips and lessons along the way. I hope to write a more succinct guide depicting the steps and strategies to break into the tech field, but for now here’s a story on carpet cleaning and strange interviews.
At the end of my sophomore year of college, most of my friends had already landed their first software engineering internships. I had applied to several openings, but received nothing more than rejection letters and the occasional “we hope you apply again next year!” I come from a low income, blue-collar background where saving money over the summer was a necessity, so I couldn’t afford working an unpaid internship.
This left me in the all-too common situation of applying for entry-level positions requiring relevant experience that I simply did not have.
A few weeks after finals and realizing my fate was sealed, I began working for a family friend cleaning carpets. While I have nothing but respect for blue collar jobs, nothing motivates you more to take your career seriously than cleaning the carpets of your own university’s Fraternity houses. You think scrubbing up a spilled beer with an old towel the morning after really works? Think again. As if that weren’t enough, the decades-old van I worked in had literally caught fire four times. The seat belts had burned away without replacement. If I happened to hit my head on the ceiling over a bump, black soot would fall down onto my lap. Since the job was paid in cash there was no paperwork, but I seriously considered asking at least for a waiver of my bodily safety. In short, it was a motivator for my success. The work was only part-time, so I took an extra job tutoring at-risk youth as well. That experience deserves an entire article in itself, but that’s for another day...
